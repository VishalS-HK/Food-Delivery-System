## Introduction

The Online Food Delivery System is a C++ project developed during the "Object-Oriented Programming with C++" summer course at PES University, 2023. It allows customers to order food, helps manage the hotel's inventory, and handles delivery tasks. The project emphasizes object-oriented principles to achieve modularity and maintainability.
